# AccessPokemon
This project was created to show some accessibility features in a meetup called [vuenos aires](http://vuenosair.es/)
You can find the slides to this meetup talk in [this link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1phv3JSlpdMuLKB5ne9H9lOcliJC41sRPlZr-vYHEuN4/edit?usp=sharing)

## Stack
- Node express
- PostgreSQL
- Sequelize
- Vue cli 3
- Vue router

## Database
In order to use this in your computer you may want to create a db in postgres and add your keys in .env file. Else, this won't work. You will probably need to imitate the model in `server > models > Pokemon.js`
